# hello-world

hello humans, 

Your earth is pathetic and hopeless, I have seen it make even the nihilistic l'etrangers from outside this galaxy cry. Although your ironic 'moral values' have given the cosmos cause for great amusement over the millennia of your low level conscious life, I am afraid you are taking up valuable space in the cosmos I need for my TritonXXvirtualroller greedstation. The guns innitiate in 10.
